Please refer to my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=FVbKUDAAAAAJ) page for more information.

## Research Directions

My research interests include multi-agent systems and AI for decision and control, with applications in [power systems](#ai-supported-power-systems) and [robotics](#multi-robot-systems).

### AI-supported Power Systems

We are working on harnessing uncertainties in modern power systems with AI techniques. We are particularly interested in developing methods to model and optimize power systems with uncertainty, and to use AI to support power system operations. We have published several research papers on this topic, and we are currently working on developing new AI algorithms to address the challenges of power system modeling and control, including but not limited to virtual power plant modeling and optimization, power system security control, and energy markets and management.

Below are some of the methods and frameworks that we developed for power systems assisted by AI.

### Multi-robot Systems

We are working on developing multi-agent systems with intelligent behaviors. We are particularly interested in developing methods to enable robots to understand and interact with environments, and to cooperate as a team to complete complex tasks. We have published several research papers on this topic, and we are currently working on developing new AI algorithms to address the challenges of multi-agent systems, e.g., path planning and task planning of robotic swarms in complex environments.

Below are some of the methods and frameworks that we developed for multi-robot systems.
