        <p>I am currently an associate professor at the Department of Automation, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I received the B.S. degree in mathematics from Shandong University in 2010, the M.S. degree in control science and engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2013, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of California, Riverside in 2017. I am currently an associate professor in the Department of Automation, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Prior to that, I was a control scientist and an electrical engineer at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. My research interests include multi-agent systems and AI for decision and control, with applications in power systems and robotics.</p>
